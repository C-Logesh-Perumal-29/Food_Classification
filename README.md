## Overview

   - This project focuses on the classification of food items using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques. The goal is to identify various food items based on images, employing machine learning and deep learning methodologies.
   - The Convolutional Neural Network, a widely used image classification technique, is employed to achieve accurate predictions. Pre-trained models, leveraging transfer learning, are utilized to enhance the model's understanding of food images, resulting in improved classification accuracy.

## Project Structure

  - The project is implemented using Python and several libraries, including TensorFlow for building and training the CNN model, Streamlit for creating a user-friendly web application, and Lottie for integrating animated elements into the interface. The application allows users to upload images or use live camera input to obtain predictions regarding the type of food present in the image.
